# Personal Expense Tracker

Toy project to refresh some python basics in the context of the [Applied Generative AI Specialization](https://bootcamp-sl.discover.online.purdue.edu/applied-artificial-intelligence-course#what-topics-are-covered-in-the-purdue-simplilearn-applied-generative-ai-course).

The [scripts](/scripts) folder includes two scripts about a program dedicated to track the expenses of the user. There is a [jupyter notebook](/scripts/00_step_1.ipynb) including explanations about the program and example usages. There is also a [python script](/scripts/01_step_2.py) that can be used to run the program locally. For doing that, it is only required to download the script, give permissions (`chmod +x ./01_step_2.py`) and then run the script (`./01_step_2.py`). In this way, the program can be run interactively in a Terminal. 

The program will offer several options to the user. This includes adding and visualize expenses, tracking a monthly budget and save expenses as a CSV file. It also offers the possibily to generate multiple "synthetic" expenses entries in case the user want to check beforehand the functioning of the program with hundreds of entries ("Demo" mode).
